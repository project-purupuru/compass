"""cycle-109 Sprint 4 T4.3 — aggregate_findings + IMP-006 conflict-resolution.

Per SDD §5.4.2:

  1. Same (file, line, finding_class) → dedupe; keep highest severity;
     union evidence_anchors.
  2. Same (file, line) different class → keep both; annotate
     cross_chunk_overlaps.
  3. Same class different line → keep both.
  4. Conflicting severity for same logical finding → escalate to max;
     annotate severity_escalated_from with the min.
  5. Finding spans chunk boundary → cross-chunk pass (T4.4 second-stage).

The aggregator is pure (no I/O, no global state) and deterministic.
Output finding order is canonical (sorted by (file, line, class)) so
downstream consumers can compare snapshots.

T4.4 cross-chunk pass: aggregate_findings invokes detect_boundary_findings
+ second_stage_review + merge_with_second_stage at the tail. While T4.4
is still stubbed (raises NotImplementedError), the wiring tolerates the
exception so the IMP-006 path lands cleanly. T4.4 replaces the stubs
with real impl and the second_stage_invoked flag flips.
