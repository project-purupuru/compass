# Safe KEY=VALUE parser replacing `set -a; source .env; set +a`.
#
# Issue #898: the legacy pattern executes ANY bash inside .env files,
# including `$(...)`, backticks, and chained commands. A hostile or
# carelessly-edited .env at the repo root becomes arbitrary code
# execution as the Loa orchestrator process. This loader parses lines
# as `KEY=VALUE` only — never executes the value.
#
# Public API:
#   load_env_file <path>
#     Reads <path> line-by-line, exports each well-formed KEY=VALUE
#     into the current shell. Silently no-ops if the file is absent
#     (matches `[[ -f .env ]] && source .env` semantics).
#
# Trust model:
#   - .env / .env.local remain UNTRUSTED. The loader refuses to expand
#     `$(...)`, backticks, or unquoted shell-meta chains.
#   - Single-quoted values pass through raw (no escape expansion).
#   - Double-quoted values expand ONLY \n \t \\ \" — NEVER $VAR / $(...).
#   - Bare values (no quotes) are accepted if they pass the safety gate.

# bug-898 SEC-001 v4 — positive allowlist of key names load_env_file will
# export. Anything NOT matching at least one of these patterns is rejected
# (warn-and-continue). This is the architecturally clean answer to the
# v1-v3 denylist whack-a-mole. Patterns are bash glob (`*` wildcards).
#
# Adding a key: append the literal name OR a pattern. The allowlist is
# intentionally narrow — extend it deliberately, with rationale, and
# prefer parent-process-set env vars for project-local keys when possible.
#
# Allowlist tiers (BB #912 v6 SEC-001 fix — credential-vs-destination separation):
#   Tier 1 (credentials) — exfiltratable but NOT redirecting. .env may carry these.
#   Tier 2 (destinations) — redirecting (and thus credential-exfiltrating in transit).
#                            MUST come from parent env or .env.local, NEVER from .env.
# Rationale: a hostile .env at repo root that sets OPENAI_BASE_URL to an
# attacker-controlled endpoint will silently exfiltrate every API call's
# headers + bodies (including real API keys sourced from parent env or
# .env.local). Allowlisting destinations alongside credentials collapses
# two threat tiers into one. Operators who need a non-default base URL for
# Bedrock / Vertex / a corporate proxy MUST set it via the parent process or
# .env.local — both are trusted boundaries that .env is not.
