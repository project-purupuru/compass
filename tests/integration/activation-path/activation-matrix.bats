# cycle-109 Sprint 3 T3.1 (FR-3.5 / FR-3.10 / IMP-009) — Activation
# Regression Matrix scaffolding. Commit A in the SDD §5.3.1 sequence.
#
# 810-cell matrix: consumers (9) × roles (5) × response_classes (6) ×
# dispatch_paths (3). Each cell asserts that the verdict_quality envelope
# the consumer surfaces matches the expected status for that
# (consumer, role, response_class, dispatch_path) tuple.
#
# Sprint 3 lifecycle:
#   Commit A (T3.1 — THIS): scaffolding + dimension counts + SKIPPED placeholder.
#     Legacy adapter still on disk; matrix execution deferred.
#   Commit B (T3.2-T3.5): Cluster B regression fixes at cheval path; matrix
#     still SKIPPED (legacy present).
#   Commit C (T3.6): is_flatline_routing_enabled branches removed; matrix
#     wires up against cheval path; CELLS GO LIVE.
#   Commit D (T3.7): DESTRUCTIVE — legacy file deletion (operator-approval
#     C109.OP-S3 required); matrix asserts G-4 legacy LOC = 0.
#
# Why this is a load-bearing scaffold even before live execution:
#   - Pins the dimension counts (any drift fails the matrix-shape test).
#   - Loads dimensions.json so refactors of the data file fail loudly.
#   - Validates that fixture-dir conventions exist (T3.2-T3.5 fill them).
#   - Establishes the bats harness pattern T3.10 CI workflow consumes.

# explode test-suite reporting). Per-cell granularity comes back when
# T3.10 CI workflow shards by consumer.
